What is gulag?
------

gulag is my take on the abstraction of an osu! server; I use native async/await
syntax, and have written the server from the ground up from sockets using my
[python package](https://github.com/cmyui/cmyui_pkg)'s web server implementation.
This relatively low-level design allows for flexibility, cleanliness, and efficiency
not seen in other codebases - all while maintaining the simplicity of Python.

A primary goal of gulag is to keep our codebase a developer-friendly API, so
that programming remains about the logic and ideas, rather than the code itself.

I'm mainly writing this as it's by-far the subject I'm currently the most
educated in.. I started [Akatsuki](https://akatsuki.pw/) (and programming
alltogether) back in October of 2017, and I've been managing it since.

The server has come [a long way](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/616400094408736779/799434379176574986/unknown.png),
and is in quite a usable state. We most likely handle every packet/handler
supported by any competing server implementation, and feature a very large
api and [commandset](#currently-supported-player-commands) for both developers
and players alike, with many unique features only available with gulag.

gulag's database structure is built from the ground up using no specific
references; this makes it incompatible with common stacks like Ripple's.
[gulag-web](https://github.com/Yo-ru/gulag-web) is a project being developed
primarily by the community members of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ShEQgUx)
who are interested in the project; they aim to atleast create a fully
functional frontend, while the location of the API remains undecided.
Over the past few weeks the development effort has been growing and some
great progress is starting to be made; I'd recommend checking it out!

```

Requirements
------

- Some know-how with Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04), python, and general-programming knowledge.
- An osu! account (or more specifically, an osu! api key). This is technically optional, but is required for full usage.
- An SSL Certificate for c(e4-6).ppy.sh (such as [this](https://github.com/osuthailand/ainu-certificate)).

Setup
------

Setup should be pretty simple - the commands below should set you right up.

Notes:

- Ubuntu 20.04 is known to have issues with nginx and osu for unknown reasons?
- I will not be able to help you out with creating a custom certificate of your own.
- If you have any difficulties setting up gulag, feel free to join the Discord server at the top of the README, we now have a bit of a community!

```sh
# Install python3.9 (requires ppa).
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-dev python3.9-distutils

# Install pip for 3.9.
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.9 get-pip.py && rm get-pip.py

# Install our database, reverse-proxy, and build tools.
sudo apt install mysql-server nginx build-essential

# Clone gulag from github.
git clone https://github.com/cmyui/gulag.git && cd gulag

# Init & update submodules.
git submodule init && git submodule update

# Build oppai-ng's binary.
cd oppai-ng && ./build && cd ..

# Install gulag's requirements.
python3.9 -m pip install -r ext/requirements.txt

# Import gulag's database structure.
# NOTE: create an empty database before doing this.
# This will also insert basic osu! channels & the bot.
mysql -u your_sql_username -p your_db_name < ext/db.sql

# Add gulag's nginx config to your nginx/sites-enabled.
# NOTE: default unix socket location is `/tmp/gulag.sock`,
# and you will have to change the certificate paths in
# the nginx config file to your own certificate paths.
sudo ln ext/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/gulag.conf
sudo nginx -s reload

# Configure gulag.
cp ext/config.sample.py config.py
nano config.py

# Start the server.
./main.py
```
